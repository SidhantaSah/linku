         <li> <p>An analog clock is a timekeeping device that uses rotating hands to indicate hours, minutes. </p></li>
          <li>  <p>sometimes seconds, on a numbered circular dial, with movement powered by either mechanical gears or a quartz battery system.</p></li>
          <li> <p>this system are used watching time zone and extra things which are used to human life  essential.</p></li>
           <li><p>people generally used this clock for their benefit purpose  and it used rich any palces first manner .</p></li>
           <li> <p>it is used by human to occupy the basic needs and it is very useful for humanbeing to used it</p></li>

              An analog clock shows time on a circular dial with rotating hands for hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds, using either mechanical or quartz movement.</p></li>
          <li> <p>Each number on the dial represents both the hour and its multiple on the minute scale. For example, "1" represents 1:00 or 5 minutes past the hour.</p></li>
          <li>  <p>The minute hand moves through the 12 numbers, each representing 5-minute increments (i.e., 1 = 5 mins, 2 = 10 mins, and so on).</p></li>

        <li>  <p>Size and Composition: Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 km (7,918 miles) and is primarily composed of rock and metal. Its structure consists of several layers, including the crust, mantle, and core (which is divided into a liquid outer core and a solid inner core).</p></li>
         <li> <p>Phasellus vel vestibulum dui, non interdum turpis. Integer vitae magna malesuada, interdum lorem ut, venenatis urna. Curabitur malesuada elit et arcu tincidunt, nec aliquam nisl pharetra. Aliquam erat volutpat. Quisque sagittis, mauris sit amet cursus cursus, justo ex commodo orci, in malesuada leo turpis eget dui.Atmosphere: The atmosphere is made up mostly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), along with trace amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide and argon. This atmosphere regulates temperature, protects from harmful solar radiation, and sustains life through the oxygen cycle.</p></li>
         <li> <p>Hydrosphere: Earth is often called the "Blue Planet" because over 70% of its surface is covered by water, primarily in oceans. These vast oceans, along with freshwater lakes, rivers, and glaciers, are part of the hydrosphere that plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate..</p></li>
         <li> <p>Orbit and Rotation: Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) and completes one orbit every 365.25 days. It also rotates on its axis every 24 hours, causing the cycle of day and night. Earth’s axial tilt (about 23.5 degrees) is responsible for the changing seasons..</p></li>
         <li> <p>Biosphere: The combination of Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and land masses supports a rich biosphere with millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms. It is the only planet known to have liquid water and life, which has evolved over billions of years..</p></li>
         <li> <p>Earth’s outer shell is divided into large pieces called tectonic plates, which float on the semi-fluid mantle beneath them. The movement of these plates causes earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the creation of mountains. This process is known as plate tectonics and is unique among the planets in our solar system, playing a crucial role in the carbon cycle and helping regulate Earth’s climate over geological time scales..</p></li>
         <li> <p>Earth has a strong magnetic field generated by the movement of molten iron in its outer core. This field protects the planet from harmful solar and cosmic radiation by deflecting charged particles. The magnetic field also creates phenomena like the aurora borealis (northern lights) and aurora australis (southern lights) near the polar regions...</p></li>
